## Descrption
This respository holds my application for assignment 1. It is a basic console member check in applicaiton. It allows the user to add, delete, check in, check out, and print users. There is a video demo of the application here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B35uJjZv1CI&feature=youtu.be

## Backlog
- More input validation
